###Marketing Research Team
As a marketing research team, I want a website that:
* displays products and surveys users, so that I can assess what products are of most interest to potential customers
* tracks and displays survey results, both by 
    * total number of votes received per product, and 
    * percentage of times an item was selected compared to number of times it was displayed
* engages a potential customer and encourages them to participate

###Focus Group Participant
As a focus group participant, I want:
* my voice to be heard
* a survey that is engaging and easy to use, so that my input can be received
* confirmation that my input has been received
* the page to repopulate with images
* to click on an image to vote
* to know when I've used up all of my votes

###Developer
As a developer, I want:
* to display images randomly, 3 to a page without repeating any images on a give page
* to track survey input
* to calculate total number of times an image is selected 
* to calculate total number of times an image is displayed
* to calculate total number of times an image is displayed and not selected
* to develop an engaging interface with a decent look / feel, or at the very least an interface that neither frustrates nor is off-putting to the user
